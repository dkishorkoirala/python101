what will we learn today

-how to run python code
-print() function
-variables and basic data types
-simple math operation

1. hello world! 
in python, print() is used to show output

print("Hello, ai world!")

output
Hello, ai world!

2. variables in python
variables store information

name = "alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6

name is a string
age is an integer
height is a float(decimal number)

we can print them as
print("Name: ", name)
print("Age: ", age)
print("Height: ", height)

3. Basic math in python
we can do simple math:

a = 10
b = 3

print("Addition: ", a+b)
print("Subtraction: ", a-b)
print("Multiplication: ", a*b)
print("Division: ", a/b)
print("Modulus: ", a%b)

practice time! (do these on your own)
1. print your own name and age using variables.
2. create two numbers and :
-add them
-multiply them
-find remainder

3. create a variable year_of_birth and calculate your age using:
current_year = 2025

#challenges (optional)

write a python program that asks the user for their name and age and then print

hi [name], you will be [age+1] next year!

hint 
name = input("what is your name? ")
age = int(input("what is your age? "))
