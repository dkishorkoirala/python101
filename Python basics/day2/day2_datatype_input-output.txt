review: we will learn
data types: (int , float, str, bool)
user input using input()
type conversion

1. data type in python:
a = 10 #int
b= 3.14 #float
name = "alice" #str
is_ai = True #bool

check the type
print (type(a))     #<class 'int'>
print (type(name))  #<class 'str'>

2. getting input from user
name = input("enter your name: ")
print("hello", name)

the default input() is string

3. convering input to numbers
age = int (input("enter your age: "))
print("next year you'll be", age + 1)

other ex.
height = float(input("enter your height in meters: "))
print("you etered", height, "meters.")

Practice Tasks:
Ask the user for their name and birth year, and calculate their age.

Take two numbers from the user:

Print their sum

Print their product

Print their average

Mini-Challenge
Ask:

Name

Age

Favorite number

Then print:
Hi [name], you're [age] years old.
Your favorite number doubled is [fav_number * 2].
