what we'll learn
-while loop
-for loop
-range()
-loop control: break, continue, pass

1. while loop
repeats as long as a condition is true

i = 1 
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

output
1
2
3
4
5

2. for loop with range()
used when we know how many times to loop

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

1
2
3
4
5

Note: range(start, stop)-> goes from start to stop -1

3. loop control statement
-break - stops the loop

for i in range (1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print (1)

1
2
3
4

continue - skips current iteration

for i in range (1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)

1
2
4
5

pass - does nothing (placeholder)

for i in range(3):
    pass # used when code is yet to be written


practice exercise
1.print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop
2. print even numbers between 1 to 20 using a for loop
3. print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user
(eg. 5 * 1 =5)
4. sum all numbers from 1 to n (user input) using a loop

challenge
ask the user to enter a number
print "Fizz" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5 
and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5 (1 to 50)
