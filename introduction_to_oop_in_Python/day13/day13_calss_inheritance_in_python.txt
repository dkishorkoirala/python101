we will cover
-what is inheritance in OOP
-how to create a child class from a parent class
-using super() to access parent methods
-overriding methods in child classes

1. what is inheritance?
inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit attributes and methods
form another class(parent)

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

d = Dog()
d.speak() # output "animal speaks"

-Dog gets the speak() method form Animal without writing it again!

2. using super() to extend behaviour 
We use super() in child classes to call methods or constructors of the 
parent  class

class Animal:
    def __init__ (self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barks. It is a {self.breed}")

d = Dog("Buddy", "Golden retriever")
d.speak() # output "Buddy barks. It is a Golden retriever"

3. method overriding
child class can change (override) a method from the parent class.

class Animal:
    def speak(Self):
        print ("generic animal sound")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("meow")

now Cat().speak() will print "meow" instead of "generic animal sound"

practice tasks.
1. create a class Person with attributes name and age, and a method show_info()
create a child class Student that inherits from Person and adds an attribute grade
override the show_info() method to include the grade.

2. create a base class Shape with method area() (print"Calculating area ...")
create a child class Rectangle that inherits Shape and overrides area()
to print actual area of a Rectangle using length and width


challenge task: Bank system
create a BankAccount class with:
- attributes: owner, balance
-method: deposit(amount), withdrawl(amount), and display()

create a SavingAccount class that inherits from BankAccount and :
-add an attribute: interest_rate
-overrides display() to show the interest rate too
