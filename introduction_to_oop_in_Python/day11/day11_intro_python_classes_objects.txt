what will we cover
-what is class?
-what is an object?
-__init__() constructor
-writing your first real class
-basic object methods
-hands on exercises

1. what is class?
- A class is like a blueprint or template. Think of it like a cookie-cutter
it defines what every cookie(object) should be shaped like


class Dog:
    pass #we'll add things inside later

2. what is an object?
an object is a specific thing created using that class. It's like an actual
 cookie made from the cutter


my_dog = Dog()
print(type(my_dog)) # <class'__main__.Dog'>

3. The __init__() method
This is special method runs automatically when you create an object. It's 
used to initialize values.

Class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

now we can create objects with real info:

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

4. Adding a method:(action)

we can define actions our object can do:

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print(f"The {self.name} says Woof!")
    
now call it
dog1 = Dog("nakkale")
dog1.bark()
#output is : The nakkale says Woof!

5. Homework

write a class called Car with:
-attribute : brand, year, and price
-a method display_info() to print these values

Create a class Movie that represent a movie object
- attribute: title, director, and year
method
- display_info() to print these values
-is_classic() -prints "Classic Movie" if year is before 2000, other wise "Modern Movie"
