Review: class, Object, Attribute, Methods

class = Blueprint or Design
Object = actual thing created from the Blueprint
__init__() = constructor that runs when object is created.
self = refers to the current object (object calling the method)
Attributes = variables inside a class.
Mthods= function inside a class

ex:1. crate a car class

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
    
    def drive(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model} is driving")

#creating an object
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
car2 = Car("Tesla", "Model s")

car1.drive()
car2.drive()

output:
The Toyota Camry is driving
The Tesla Model s is driving

ex-2: create a student Class:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name , grade):
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade
    
    def intro(self):
        print(f"Myself {self.name}, I study in Grade: {self.grade}")
    

#test
student1 = Student("Rahul", "10th")
student2 = Student("samir", "7th")

student1.intro()
student2.intro()

output:
Myself Rahul, I study in Grade: 10th
Myself samir, I study in Grade: 7th

ex-3: Simple Calculator class
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, a , b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
    
    def add(self):
        return self.a + self.b
    
    def multiply(self):
        return self.a * self.b
    
#creating object and using methods
calc = Calculator(2,6)
print("Sum of two numbers are: ", calc.add())
print("Multiplication of two numbers are: ", calc.multiply())

ex-4: Movie Calss with show method()
class Movie:
    def __init__(self, title, director, year):
        self. title = title
        self. director = director
        self.year = year
    
    def show(self):
        print(f"Move: {self.title}, Director: {self.director}, Year: {self.year}")
    
m1 = Movie("Inception", "Christopher Nolan", 2010)
m1.show()

m2 = Movie("3 Idiot", "Rajkumar Hirani", 2009)
m2.show()

output:
Move: Inception, Director: Christopher Nolan, Year: 2010
Move: 3 Idiot, Director: Rajkumar Hirani, Year: 2009

Try-it-yourself:
Task1:
make a class called BankAccount with:
    -attribute: owner, balance
    -method: display(), that prints"{owner} has {balance} in account."

Task 2:
make a class called Book with:
-attribute: title, author
-method: display(), that prints "Reading {title} by {author}..."

Task 3:
make a class called Laptop with:
    - attribute: brand, price
    - method: details(), that prints: "This is a {brand} laptop that costs {price}."
